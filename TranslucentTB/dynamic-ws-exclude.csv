; There are 3 possible ways to exclude windows from the dynamic feature:
;
; Title of the window. This one checks if the title contains the substring instead of searching for an exact match
; example:
; title, Command Prompt
;
; Name of the .exe file. This one is case insensitive
; example:
; exename, cmd.exe
;
; Window class name. Can be found with programs like Window Spy from AutoHotKeys or Spy++
; example
; class, ConsoleWindowClass
;
; As you might have noticed, lines beginning with ";" are comments.


; If you find dynamic windows does not works correctly, uncomment the following line. It will blacklist all UWP apps (which are known to be buggy with dynamic windows).
; exename, ApplicationFrameHost.exe
